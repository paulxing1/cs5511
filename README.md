java c CEG 8019: Individual Report You will be assigned one of the scenarios listed below. Your task is to develop a simulation model (simulation period = 1 hour) that accurately reflects the given scenario. In your report, describe the model development process in detail, including the setup, parameters used, and any assumptions made. Additionally, include screenshots of key steps and present the simulation results. Scenario 1: Urban Intersection with Fixed-time Traffic Signal Control. •    Intersection with 4 approaches, each with 2 lanes (one for straight/left turns, one for right turns). •    Traffic volumes: 800 vehicles per hour (vph) per approach. •    Implement fixed-time signal control •    Outputs: vehicle delays, queue lengths at each approach. Scenario 2: Two-Lane Roundabout with Heavy Truck Traffic •    Roundabout with four entry points. •    Traffic volumes: 400 vph with 25% heavy trucks per approach. •    Outputs: vehicle delays, queue lengths. Scenario 3: Motorway On-Ramp with Metering Control •    On-ramp with one lane merging into a 3-lane motorway. •    Traffic volumes: 1,500 vphon the motorway, 500 vphon the ramp. •    Ramp metering allows one vehicle per green signal. •    Highway speed limit: 70 mph; ramp speed limit: 50 mph. •    Outputs: motorway flow, ramp queues. Scenario 4: Multi-Lane Arterial with Lane Closure for Construction •    3-lane arterial road with one lane closed for construction. •    Traffic volumes: 2,000 vphon the arterial road. •    Traffic management includes temporary signals and reduced speed limits (down to 30 mph from 50 mph). •    Outputs: travel times, queue lengths. Scenario 5: On-Street Parking and Mixed Traffic •    A two-lane road accommodating both cars and bicycles with on-street parking on one side. •    Traffic volumes: 400 vph with 100 bicycles per hour. •    Include parked vehicles and their effects on lane usage and traffic flow. •    Outputs代 写CEG 8019: Individual ReportJava 代做程序编程语言: delays of different traveller types. Submission Requirements: Submit your assignment as a single document. Ensure the report is well-organized and professionally written. Submission deadline: 22nd November, 2024 (2pm) Assessment Criteria: Your assignment will be assessed based on the following criteria: The overall quality of the report, including clarity and presentation. Quality of the simulation model as well as the description of the model development process and presentation of simulation outputs.
